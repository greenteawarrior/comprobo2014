am i parallel to the wall?

    yes, so i'm going to go straight and check that i'm staying parallel
        
        are you still parallel?
            yes, go straight
            no, you should turn


    no, so i'm going to turn until i am parallel

        turning! 

        are you parallel yet?
            yes, go straight
            no, you should turn appropriately
