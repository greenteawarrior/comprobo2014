semester timeline:
setup+warmup project
mobile robotics project
computer vision project
final project


mobile robotics project
2-3 people
talk to paul about ideas


localization
    SLAM
    particle filters
path planning
    path planning in ROS
    learning by demonstration (#SHUML!! - maybe for final project though)
multi-agent systems
    swarm things

open-ended project considerations
    -wait to use the camera (there's a CV project after this one)
    -have a well-defined and realistic MVP
    -don't overestimate the neato
    -make sure that the choice of project topic lines up w/learning goals
        -algorithm oriented
            SLAM? path planning? etc
        -task oriented?
            design a robot that does ____
