can push topics into a subfolder
handle multiple robots

multiagent launch?
so... r2d2, johnnyfive

a publisher for each robot 

quick review of using rviz

keeping track of multiple coordinate systems
and transform between them

add > by display type > robot model 


software design advice:
have a class for each of the nodes you write

def __init__(self):
    rospy.init_node('wall_follower', anonymous=True)
    self.pub = rospy.Publisher('cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10) 
    self.sub = rospy.Subscriber('scan', LaserScan, self.scan_received, pub)
    self.mean_distance = -1.0

pass in self, change mean_distance to self.mean_distance

a run method - nice convention

typical robotics design pattern: control loop
things of state of robot are being kept track of in other threads



showing us how to use the neato simulator:

mux thing
remap a topic thing from one thing to another?


insert objects into the world
grey wall for wall following

lolol fast food places 
probably not doing well in this world with only one robot

it can push a bowl! 
"yaaaay gooo... fake neato!"


rviz

gotcha: laserfinder
if you go outside the thing
it'll return the max value

max range is ~5m

just account for this fact in the code: cut off anything greater than 5



coordinate frames
chassis centered at baselink
laserlink

base_laser_link
base_link
odom

moving coordinate system with respect to base length, ros can handle all these different coordinate frames and their changes over time; 



kinematics of a robot

assume wheels of robot are not slipping
there's always some point in space in which the robot is rotating

no matter what vels are sent to the left/right wheel, it's always rotating about some fixed pt in space

instantaneous center of curvature
ICC

take the vector
omega*t
rotate as necessary
