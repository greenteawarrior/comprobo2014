some day3 comprobo notes

Notes for neato usage:

Wait a while so the ping is good
Look for blue blinky wifi light
Check the ribbon cable
Make sure the pi's powered on


starting from the publish/chatter example

instead of a string, using twist on cmd_vel



pseudo code for different neato movements:

sin wave? going from side to side
tracking velocity? 

making functions: take in a vector, do computations, send a twist 

msg = Twist(Vector3(...))


-----

closing the perception/action loop

sensory data
perform some computation to get useful info
modify the command you send to the robot 

$ rostopic msg scan
$ rostopic type /scan
$ rosmsg show sensor_msgs/LaserScan
